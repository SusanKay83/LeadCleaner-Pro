# 🧹 Lead Cleaner Pro — Python Data Cleaning Portfolio Project

Hi! I’m **Susan Kay**, and I help small businesses, insurance agents, real estate teams, and sales reps **clean up messy lead lists** so they don’t waste money on bad data.

---

## ✅ What This Tool Does

**Lead Cleaner Pro** is a simple, custom Python script that:
- Removes rows with missing emails or phone numbers
- Removes duplicate contacts
- Strips extra spaces from names, emails, and phone numbers
- Capitalizes names properly
- Validates emails (basic format)
- Cleans phone numbers down to digits only

---

## 📊 Why It Matters

Uploading messy data costs businesses time and money:
- Sales teams waste dials on invalid numbers
- Bad emails bounce and hurt deliverability
- Duplicate records confuse CRMs

**This script fixes that — automatically — in seconds.**

## 🗂️ How It Works

1️⃣ Place your raw lead file (`test_leads.csv`) in the folder  
2️⃣ Run `lead_cleaner_pro.py` — or I run it for you  
3️⃣ Get a **clean**, upload-ready `cleaned_leads_pro.csv`
